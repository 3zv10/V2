                Project Replay is a passion project created by fans, for fans. We've meticulously 
                recreated Fortnite's Season 2 Chapter 2 experience on private servers, allowing 
                you to revisit one of the most beloved eras of the game.

                Remember dropping at The Rig? Landing at The Grotto? Those epic squad matches 
                that lasted until sunrise? We do too, and we wanted to bring that magic back.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our custom launcher connects you to our dedicated servers where you can play with 
                friends old and new, experiencing the game exactly as it was during its peak.
